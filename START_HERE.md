## ✅ What Was Cleaned Up

### **Removed from Root Directory:**
All old HTML files have been moved to `_old_html_files/` folder:
- ❌ home.html (old)
- ❌ dashboard.html (old)
- ❌ admin-login.html (old)
- ❌ And 15+ other old HTML files

### **What Remains in Root:**

- ✅ `_old_html_files/` - Archived old files (for reference)
- ✅ Documentation files (*.md)

## 🔄 If You Need Old Files

All old HTML files are safely stored in:
`D:\Kaiten Software\Review Site\version 2\_old_html_files\`

You can reference them anytime, but they are NOT used by the application anymore.

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Always run `npm run dev`** before opening the app for development
2. **The old HTML files are archived** - they won't interfere anymore
3. **Use the React app** for all new development
4. **Old files are kept** just for reference (you can delete them later if not needed)
